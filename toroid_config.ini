# Toroid Generator Configuration File
# =====================================
# This file allows you to customize toroid generation parameters
# without modifying the code or using command-line arguments.

[geometry]
# Major radius (R): Distance from center of hole to center of tube [Å]
R_target = 6.0

# Minor radius (r): Radius of the tube itself [Å]
r_cyl = 2.5

# Overlap tolerance: Distance threshold for duplicate removal [Å]
overlap_tolerance = 1.0

[input_output]
# Input CIF file with unit cell structure
input_file = Li2O2.cif

# Output XYZ file for generated toroid
output_file = toroid_output.xyz

[relaxation]
# Enable pre-relaxation with Lennard-Jones potential (true/false)
enable_prerelax = false

# Lennard-Jones epsilon parameter [eV]
lj_epsilon = 0.002

# Lennard-Jones sigma parameter [Å]

# Maximum steps for pre-relaxation
